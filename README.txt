In order to run my python code, simply place the my-dns-client.py file in the current working directory and enter the following command:

	python3 my-dns-client.py domain-name

where domain-name can be something like "gmu.edu" or "www.yahoo.com"

If there's an issue, then prefixing the my-dns-client.py with a ./ should do the trick.
